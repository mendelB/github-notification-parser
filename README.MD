# Github Notification Parser

### Context

I was getting many, many, many, many security vulnerability notifications on Github, which were cluttering and affecting my Notifications page. I'm part of an organization with thousands of repositories, hence the barrage. 

I didn't want to mute all notifications from this organization, but could not find any built in graceful setting to quiet these notifications. So I threw together a quick function to use the Github API to take care of this for me. 

### What's it do?
